					<h2>What is META?</h2>
				  <p>The service helps medical technology companies optimise development plans for a single medical technology. By using META, you can identify the level of evidence needed to show the product’s value to the NHS and detect gaps in your existing evidence base.. </p>
				  <p>The recommendations from the service will:<br>
				  </p>
				  <ul>
					  <li>make you aware of the evidence payers, commissioners and investors need to understand the value your technology offers to patients and health systems</li>
				    <li>enable you to prioritise investment in your product’s development strategy </li>
					  
					  <li>enable you to develop an evidence-base for your product claims that will stand scrutiny of a health technology assessment (HTA)..</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How?</h2>

				
					<p>At the end of the process you will::<br>
				  </p>
				  <ul>
					  <li>be able to refine your value proposition </li>
					  <li>have gaps in evidence that prevent you demonstrating your product's value to payers identified to you </li>
					  
					  <li>be informed of local, regional or national support available to  help you generate the missing evidence to support your products claims</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>How the service works</h2>
				  <p><b>1.   Sign in or register for the service</b></p>
					<p><strong>2.   Select the organisation you want to facilitate your META consultation </strong></p>
					<p>You can choose from a range facilitation organisations. These organisations have different specialist areas, so you can pick the one that suits you and your product best. All the facilitators are fully trained.</p>
					<p><b>3. Complete and submit a synopsis of your product</b>
					<p>You submit:</p>
						<li>details on your product </li>
	<li>high level development plans. </li>
					<p>This is done through an online synopsis form, which is part of the tool. </p>
<p>The sections in the form cover a wide range of topics relevant to the product development plans including:</p>
					<li>Health Technology Assessment requirements</li>
					<li>defining and understanding system benefits </li>
					<li>discussing clinical and economic evidence generation.</li>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>4. Facilitation</p></b>
Your facilitator reviews your submission and invites you to attend a consultation, where you will work through the different sections of the tool together and discuss the key issues. The consultation can be done in person, by video or on the telephone. 
			<p></p>
				<p><b>5. Report </p></b>
Your facilitator sends you a report summarising the evidence requirements and any gaps identified during the consultation. The report will also highlight areas where you should consider doing further work to generate evidence of the product’s value to the healthcare system.
The process takes approximately 4 weeks. But, this can vary depending on which facilitating organisation you choose and their availability.

					<h2>FAQs?</h2>
					<p> <b> Who is it for? </p></b>
<p>The service helps medical technology companies prepare for NICE or other payer engagement at a much earlier stage of the product development process. This potentially reduces cost and risk.</p>
It helps small companies understand the regulatory and payer frameworks, and how evidence needs are different. 
It helps large companies go through the evidence requirements for products on a consistent, affordable basis.
<br></br>
<p><b>When should I use it?</p></b>
You will benefit from using the tool at any stage of your product’s development.
In the early stages it will help you understand the types of evidence that will be needed further down the development pathway, and therefore guide efficient evidence collection.
In the later stages it will help as a ‘sense check’ before submission to us or another payer.
<br></br>
<p><b>How do I use the META tool?</p></b>
See a timeline of the process.
<br></br>
<p><b>How long does it take? </p></b>
The process takes approximately 4 weeks. But, this can vary depending on which facilitating organisation you choose and their availability. 
<br></br>
<p><b>How much does it cost? </p></b>
It costs £2000 if you use NICE Scientific Advice as your facilitating organisation.
We provide this service as a gap analysis on a cost-recovery basis. 
<br></br> 
<i><b>Other facilitating organisations may charge different amounts.</i></b> They might offer the consultation as part of a bespoke service or a larger package. We encourage you to explore options with them before choosing your facilitating organisation.
List of facilitating organisations
<br></br>
Please contact us if you would like to discuss the tool or facilitation options further. 
What kind of questions will I be asked?
The synopsis form covers a broad range of topics so that the facilitator can fully understand your product and where it is in development.  
<br></br>
<p><b>Areas covered include: </p></b>
<li>information about the technology </li>
<li>what it is indicated for </li>
<li>what benefits it has for patients and for the wider healthcare system </li>
<li>what clinical and economic data you have collected. </li> 
<p></p>
<p>This helps you to think about the issues that are important to payers and how their needs are different from the needs of regulators.</p>
<p>The form takes some time to fill in and may need input from more than one person, so it’s not something you can leave until the last day before the facilitation. </p> 

<p><b>Who should fill in the synopsis form?</p></b>
It’s up to you – it can be filled in by one person, or by multiple users. It depends on the size of your company, the complexity of the clinical development pathway, and where you are in the stage of development.  
The tool allows you to add multiple people to your company’s profile so that you can work on individual areas of expertise. 
<br></br>
<p><b>Who should attend the facilitation meeting?</p></b>
We recommend that 1-3 people should go to the facilitation session. It’s up to you who attends although ideally someone with extensive knowledge of the product’s clinical development will be there. 
<p>Attendees should be familiar with the:</p>

<li>product and how it works </li>
<li>area of care that the product would fit into </li>
<li>evidence generation that has been completed or is planned.</li>
<p></p>
<p><b>They should also be the ones who:</p></b>

<li>complete the synopsis stage </li>
<li>are present at the facilitation session </li>
<li>review the final report </li>
<li>contribute to the feedback at each stage. </li>
<p></p>
<b>Is the advice in the report binding? </b>
<br></br>
<p>No - there is no obligation to act on any of the advice you receive. </p>

<b>What doesn’t a consultation report from NICE cover?</b>
<p>It’s important to note that if you use us as your facilitating organisation, the report we provide does not:</p>
<li>give detailed step-by-step advice on exactly what to do to address the gaps in the evidence base for your technology </li>
<li>assist you in drawing up an action plan</li>
<li>provide traditional scientific advice on planned RCTs/studies </li>
<li>tell you how to price your product </li>
<li>provide an evaluation of how good the technology is.</li>
<p></p>
<p><a href="">See our full range of scientific advice services<p></a>
	Other <a href="">facilitating organisations </a>may provide different services as part of their package. 
</p><b>What type of products are suitable for a META consultation?</b></p>

The service can be used on all medical devices and diagnostics that have a CE mark or are expected to require a CE mark. It is also suitable for advising on digital products and apps.

<p>It is not suitable for technologies that have no effect on clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Can I use the tool multiple times with different products? </p></b>
Yes. Once you have set up a company account you can start multiple consultations either in parallel or in succession.

<p><b>Does going through a META consultation mean that my product is accredited by NICE? </p></b>
No. While we design and maintain the tool, licensees are not qualified to give advice on behalf of NICE and any products that go through a consultation do not gain any form of accreditation as a result.
