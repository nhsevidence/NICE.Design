          <b>An alcohol problem</b> is categorized as hazardous drinking, harmful drinking, and alcohol dependence depending on the level and pattern of alcohol consumption.

            <b>The Mesa Grande project is a systematic review that ranks the effectiveness of interventions used for the treatment of an alcohol problem. Of the interventions recommended in this CKS topic, brief intervention ranks highest (number&nbsp;1), and Alcoholics Anonymous ranks lowest (number&nbsp;38).</b>
          </p><ul><li class="level1">The Mesa Grande uses a 'box-score' method to rank interventions for the maintenance phase of alcohol treatment [<a rel="citation" resource="-450711#A26926" href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!references/-450711">Miller et al, 2003</a>]. In brief, this means randomized controlled trials are assessed for quality, and points are awarded for the intervention depending on how effective it was found to be (ranging from 2&nbsp;points for a strong positive effective, to –2&nbsp;points for a strong negative effect). Points from all the available studies are then tallied, and these are used to rank the intervention.</li><li class="level1">Although useful, the Mesa Grande has several methodological weaknesses which need to be taken into account.</li><ul><li class="level2">The most significant weakness is probably that it only reflects the evidence available. Therefore effective interventions that have been inadequately studied will rank poorly.</li><li class="level2">Other weaknesses of the box-score method include the exclusion of studies which are underpowered to show a positive or negative effect (data are not pooled in a quantitative meta-analysis); including studies that have evidence of 'cherry picking' positive outcomes from multiple outcomes; problems with heterogeneity of study populations; and problems of assessing the absolute effectiveness of interventions relative to an active control.</li></ul><li class="level1">The Mesa Grande ranking of the main interventions most relevant to this CKS topic are listed in <a href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!supportingevidence1:3/-469481">Table 1</a>.</li></ul><span class="tablecaption" id="A-469481:1">

It is probably most effective when the treatment target is abstinence, adherence is maintained, and it is accompanied by psychosocial therapy. Acamprosate is generally well tolerated, and does not interact with alcohol.</b>
          </p><ul><li class="level1">
            <b>A systematic review</b> (search date: September&nbsp;2002) identified 33&nbsp;randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acamprosate or naltrexone [<a rel="citation" resource="-450711#A26333" href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!references/-450711">Bouza et al, 2004</a>]. Thirteen trials (in 4000&nbsp;people) compared acamprosate with placebo, and one trial (in 157&nbsp;people) was a head-to-head RCT with naltrexone. Trials were generally of a high methodological standard and carried out in a community setting.</li><ul><li class="level2">
            <b>Acamprosate compared with placebo</b>
          </li><ul><li class="level3">Acamprosate increased the abstinence rate, with an odds ratio of&nbsp;1.88 (95%&nbsp;CI 1.57 to 2.25). This means that for every 10&nbsp;people treated with acamprosate, one person will abstain from alcohol who would have relapsed if untreated (NNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, 95%&nbsp;CI 7 to 15).</li><li class="level3">Acamprosate also significantly increased the cumulative abstinence duration, with a weighted mean difference of&nbsp;26.55 (95%&nbsp;CI 17.56 to 35.54), meaning that people receiving acamprosate had double the number of abstinent days as placebo.</li><li class="level3">Pooling of data from other outcomes was not possible due to heterogeneity. However, there were conflicting reports of the effects of acamprosate on craving alcohol, and a trend towards a reduction of gamma-glutamyl transferase.</li><li class="level3">Acamprosate produced few adverse effects. The most common were gastrointestinal symptoms, which occurred in 17% of people receiving the intervention compared with 11% receiving placebo.</li></ul><li class="level2">
            <b>Acamprosate compared with naltrexone. </b>One RCT reported that naltrexone was significantly superior to acamprosate in terms of abstinence, relapse, cumulative abstinence, time to relapse, number of drinks per day, degree of craving, and retention rate. Adverse effects were worse in the naltrexone group, however.</li><li class="level2">
            <b>The authors concluded </b>that both acamprosate and naltrexone are effective for the maintenance phase of treatment for alcohol dependency. However, from the available evidence it appears that acamprosate is more suitable for people aiming for abstinence, and naltrexone is better at reducing alcohol consumption in non-abstinent individuals. Both drugs have poor adherence and are only suitable for use as an adjuvant to counselling.</li></ul><li class="level1">
            <b>In contrast,</b> a more recent RCT (in 1383&nbsp;people) found no significant benefit from acamprosate [<a rel="citation" resource="-450711#A25348" href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!references/-450711">Anton et al, 2006</a>].</li><li class="level1">The efficacy of naltrexone has also been the subject of a Cochrane systematic review which found it was effective in the short-term treatment of alcohol dependence [<a rel="citation" resource="-450711#A25751" href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!references/-450711">Srisurapanont and Jarusuraisin, 2005</a>].</li></ul></section><section class="supportingevidence1 hidden" id="-469482"><header><a href="#top" class="pull-right" data-track="back to top link">Back to top</a><h2>Benzodiazepines for detoxification</h2><h3>Evidence on benzodiazepines for the detoxification of alcohol-dependent people</h3></header><p>

            <b>The best evidence for the use of benzodiazepines in alcohol detoxification comes from a Cochrane systematic review</b> (search date: August&nbsp;2004) which identified 57&nbsp;randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 4051&nbsp;participants that were suitable for inclusion [<a rel="citation" resource="-450711#A25748" href="/alcohol-problem-drinking#!references/-450711">Ntais et al, 2005</a>]. It compared the use of benzodiazepines with placebo or other classes of drugs.

Other outcomes that showed no significant difference included the occurrence of seizures, delirium, the number of withdrawals, and adverse effects (although there was a trend for benzodiazepines to cause more minor and fewer major adverse effects). There were two deaths reported in 901&nbsp;people receiving benzodiazepines, compared with five deaths in 1275&nbsp;people receiving other drugs.</li><li class="level3">The only significant difference seen between benzodiazepines and other drugs was in anxiety levels.
