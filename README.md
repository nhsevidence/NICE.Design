# NICE.Design

 

The NICE.Design repository provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on NICE.org and other NICE services using the NICE Design System.

 

## About the NICE Design System
NICE Design System is a set of reusable patterns, documentation and guidelines for rapid product development

 

Your source for quickly creating consistent on-brand NICE digital services

 

Its goal is to create a consistent, accessible digital experience across all of NICE’s services.

 

It’s a source for creating beautiful, consistent experiences across NICE’s digital services. It’s aimed at developers, designers and content editors and consists of:

 

- A base framework to give the structure of a modern web app e.g. grid, typography etc
- A pattern library of both micro and macro patterns
- A style guide for both design and code
- A set of auto-generated documentation at a code-level for both SASS and JavaScript.
- It is a re-work of NICE’s original adaptation of Bootstrap, known as NICE.Bootstrap.

 

## Our aims and principles

 

## Tested and testable
JavaScript written in a testable way with unit tests. Responsive testing. Set of manual accessibility tests.

 

## Easy to maintain and extend
It should be a living thing that gets improved and extended so it's got to be easy for developers to pick up and work on.

 

## Accessible
We aim to conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA and follow the 4 principles of accessibility of perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for our content.

 

## Modern
But not just modern for the sake of being modern. There are some amazing modern web technologies that we use to try and make great experiences.

 

## Lightweight
It's not a monolithic framework with every design pattern NICE have ever used - it's lightweight 'starter for 10' that gives just enough of a framework and as a result is lightweight and quick loading.

 

## Who is it for?

 

## Designers
Have a base and set of rules and styles from which to iterate without re-inventing the wheel.

 

## Developers
Either quickly rapidly prototype using a compiled version, or integrate it into your app and use it as a solid base.

 

## Content editors
A set of guidelines for how components should be used and a set of templates. An up-to-date source of truth to ensure consistency of use across.
